# Test task for Cloudflare

Challenge details:

"The challenge is to build a HTTP-based RESTful API for managing Customers and their Certificates. Be thoughtful about the fact that the system must eventually support millions of certificates.

A Customer:
1. Has a name
2. Has an email address
3. Has a password
4. May have zero to many Certificates

A Certificate:
1. Belongs to one and only one Customer
2. Can be either active or inactive
3. Has a private key
4. Has a certificate body

Your solution must support:
1. Creating/Deleting Customers
2. Creating Certificates
3. Listing all of a Customerâ€™s Active Certificates
4. Activating/Deactivating Certificates. If a certificate is either activated or de-activated, add the ability to notify an external system (via an HTTP post) about that fact. You could use http://httpbin.org or http://requestbin.com/ to exercise this.
5. Persistence (data must survive computer restarts)"

## Testing

1. Create a database in MongoDB with the name mentioned in the file config/database (default value: "Customer-API")
2. Open a terminal of your choice in the main folder and run `npm install`
3. Run `nodemon index`
4. Use curl or Postman to test the application's endpoints
